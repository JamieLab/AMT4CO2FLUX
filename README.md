Main Manuscript: Ford, D.J., Shutler, J.D., Blanco-Sacristán, J. et al. Enhanced ocean CO2 uptake due to near-surface temperature gradients. Nat. Geosci. 17, 1135–1140 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-024-01570-7

# Funding
This code and analysis was funded by the European Space Agency through the AMT4CO2FLUX project (https://www.amt4oceansatflux.org/)

# Changelog

v2.0.0: Release of the updated analysis code, and updated due to an issue within FluxEngine v4.0.7 that affected the calculation of fCO2(atm). Air-sea CO2 fluxes were rerun with FluxEngine v4.0.9.1, and output files have been updated to v4.
v1.0.0: Initial release of analysis code and output data (v3) coinciding with the submission of the manuscript
